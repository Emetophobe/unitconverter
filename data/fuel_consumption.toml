# dimensions = {"volume" = 1, "length" = -1}
dimensions = {"fuel consumption" = 1}


# Fuel consumption is the amount of fuel used per unit distance
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_efficiency#Measurement

# formula = volume/length

# This causes issues since volume/length = length^3/length = area
# For now use a "fuel consumption" dimension but units outside of this
# file won't be comparable, such as gallon/yard

# cubic metre per metre is the base unit
